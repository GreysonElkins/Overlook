<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62047446/89364851-acbe2a80-d690-11ea-9f3b-f5c8a6058bf5.png" alt="THE OVERLOOK but stylized">


The Overlook was a solo project done at the end of module 2 at the Turing School of Software Design. Conceptually it's a simple hotel booking website. Under the hood it's a garden of forking paths that'd make Jack Torrence shiver. 

The project was a culmination of quite a few technologies, but largely focused on interacting with APIs. 

### Built With
* Javascript and HTML
* SCSS
* A Heroku API
* Webpack
* Chai and Spies

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Getting started on the app is simple. Once you've cloned down the repo, run `npm install` and `npm install moment --save`, run `npm start` in your terminal and go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The site should be up and running, and you can log in as the manager with the password overlook2020 or  any user between 1 and 50 (customer3, password overlook2020). Click around! Book a trip! This hotel is to die for.
